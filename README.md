# ENG220-Group-19 : Finance
### Final Project Data: Finance

The contents that are included in this repository are two different types of CSV files. These files include different types of information that have been found from the project that are in relation to clean energy resources, non clean energy resources, as well as grants that are awarded to the city of santa fe that pertain to health issues like emerging diseases, STI's, and immunization from respiratory diseases.

Covid-19 Played a huge role with affecting government funding, private sector investments, and crowdfunding and community-based financing. When it came to government funding, there was more support to projects and research that involved health assistance to the public and less support for alternative energy sources.

### Clean Energy Source Analysis
The first data set, titled EPI contains the clean energy resource data, which includes different stock indexes that include companies that specialize in creating clean energy resources. The two different variables that are taken into consideration is the price of the average price of that stock for a given year. This information is taken from the performance of the stocks in the region of the state of New Mexico.

When analyzing the given information, the clean energy data showed massive increases post covid because of government subsidies, during covid the funding was allocated more towards health benefits. The opposite was seen for non clean energy sources, like with electricity, I found that there was more funding during covid since everyone became more reliant of electronic devices during lockdown. After lockdown however, there was a decrease unlike the clean energy because they didn't receive as much funding.

### Health Grant Analysis
For the second set of Data, which is titled CDC in the repository, there is a collection of different types of health grants, these health grants are awarded to the city of Santa Fe and are used to anaylze the effect that Covid-19 had on the health industry and health funding in general.

What I found to be really interesting with this dataset is that there was a lot of information that was very similar. Covid would come by and increase the overall funding by a lot, then there would be a massive decrease in funding post covid-19. What we could interpret from this data is that covid-19 played a huge role not only in the overall spending towards all sectors of the health industry.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the purpose for obtaining this data was to show how clean energy would change with uncontrollable factors like covid-19, but also how much government aide helps when it comes to the funding of clean and non-clean energy resources and research.

When it came to health spending, there was a huge similarity in the data that was gathered that showed that there was a huge reliance on the overall state of the health industry. Covid-19 proved to be a huge factor in affecting all assets that were set to health associations.
